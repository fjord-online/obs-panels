# OBS Panels
Overlays and lower thirds content for OBS live streams

OBS Panels provides highly customisable overlays for your content. Use them to show the names of your speakers, or to provide context
in the action.

(coming soon) Use overlays to show more content, such as titles, paragraphs, bullet points, images etc.

# Installation
Unlike many OBS plugins, all content required for OBS Panels is available immediately online. This removes the installation step,
and will soon unlock additional collaborative tools and features. The online version is always up to date with the latest release.

## Online
### Config panel
In OBS, go to *View > Docks > Custom Browser Docks*.

Enter a dock name (e.g. OBS Panels)

Enter the following URL in the URL field: **http://fjord-online.com/panels/config.html**

### View
Add a new source: *Sources > Add > Browser*
*
Set the URL field to the hosted URL: **http://fjord-online.com/panels/view.html**

Set the width and height to match your project resolution (e.g. 1920 x 1080, 4k is also supported)

Press OK

Ensure that the browser layer is at the top of your display: *Right click > Order > Move to top*

## Local (offline)
Download a recent release from the releases tab, or download a specific branch.

Extract the zipped folder into a suitable location (e.g. user_folder/OBS-Panels)

Follow the instructions for online installation, but replace the URLs with paths to your local config and view files
